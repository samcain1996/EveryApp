Laura Jacob -- 4/8/19 -- Week 4 Delivs

So far, we have 4 apps read from apps.txt file which will be read into the program and shown as buttons. The apps were given arbitrary application and company names for simplicity.

In the src folder, we have the main.java, Application.java, Database.java, and GUI.java files. 
The Application class has two private strings -- name and company -- a constructor method, 2 getters, and a toString method. 
The Database class loads the apps.txt (and throws exception) and stores the apps into an ArrayList. The class includes a public boolean add() method which adds the app to the database if not already in the database. There is also a public void dete() method which deletes the application when called and updates database. The method getApps() returns an array list of the apps currently stored. There is also an @Override toString() method in this class.
The GUI class extends JFrame and outlines JPanel, JButton, JTextField, JList, ArrayList, DefaultListModel and Database attributes. A public GUI constructor is created and filled. A private void is used for setInitialAttributes() method as well as a setDisplayAttributes() and refreshList()  method. There are 4 private listener classes in the GUI file: loadListener, filterListener, sortNameListener, and sortCompanyListener which all implement ActionListener class.
In the main file, a new GUI is created and a FileNotFoundException is thrown.
