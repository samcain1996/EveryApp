When a new member joins teh team he can pull up the build script and be on the same page as the intial developers. 
For the build script that the team developed starts with the project name. It also declares property name an dtheir location.
The program set up the build enviroment using the target name init, which creates the build directory. Followed by compiling 
of the code using target name compile which depends on the build file, this compiles the code from src. After compilation, 
the code is saved into the EveryApp.jar file. If we use the clean function, it deletes all the file generated by the build
and inti functions.
